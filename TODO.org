* Design considerations (thanks, Discord Quake Remastered!)

 - quake directory structure review: https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?threads/understanding-your-quake-directory-installing-custom-content.174/

 - the majority of developers use FTEQCC, and the dialect that comes with it (see
   https://www.fteqcc.org/dl/fteqcc_manual.txt)

   - majority of modes use Vanilla QuakeC but worth working on dialects as well

 - default community tools: editors, vscode with plugins

 - Collection of resources: https://github.com/dumptruckDS/awesome-quake

 - QuakeC code:

   - Quake Rerelease: https://github.com/id-Software/quake-rerelease-qc

   - Arcane Dimensions mod: https://github.com/SimsOCallaghan/ArcaneDimensions

   - 2048 mod: https://github.com/jhspetersson/q2048

   - dev kit: https://developer.vera-visions.com/ (https://github.com/VeraVisions/nuclide)

   - dev kit: progs_dump (https://github.com/progs-dump-dev/progs_dump)

 - maintained engines: FTE, Quakespams, Ironwail, vkquake
