* Emacs major mode for QuakeC files

  I was horrified to realise that there's no major mode for QuakeC files so I came up with
  this.

  Features:

  - vanilla QuakeC syntax highlighting

  - imenu navigation

  - xref-based local definition jumping

  - ElDoc inline help for local definitions

  - completion-at-point backend for local definitions

  - compile support assuming FTEQCC warning/error highlighting in Compilation buffers

  - which-function support


  In other words, this is your typical basic Emacs major-mode.

* Setup

Example setup:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-quakec-mode-hook ()

    ;; typical QuakeC conventions
    (setq-local indent-tabs-mode t)
    (setq-local tab-width 4)

    ;; Symbol completion local to a file
    (setq-local completion-at-point-functions '(quakec-completion-at-point))

    ;; Company mode backend to for completion-at-point for local
    ;; definition
    (setq-local company-backends '(company-capf))

    ;; Jump to a definition of a symbol at point within a file
    (setq-local xref-backend-functions #'quakec-xref-backend)

    ;; Setup the compilation command
    (setq-local compile-command quakec-fteqcc-compile-command))

  (use-package quakec-mode
    ;; drop the file somehwere here
    :load-path "path/to/quakec-mode"
    ;; link the extension
    :mode "\\.qc\\'"
    ;; run our configration
    :hook (quakec-mode . my-quakec-mode-hook))
#+end_src
